      <!--  A section-division is how the website expects things to be cut up,
            That being a division including text, an optional image, and then text beneath.
            Technically, there is no issue in repeating those three as much as you wish within one division,

               The Ark of The Covenant, also known as the Ark of God or the Ark of the Testimony, is the container of the Moses' tablets containing the ten commandments of the abrahamic religions.
               And also Moses's holy walking stick. 
               It was created approximately 1500 years ago with golden detailing and an ornamental seal. 
               Carried by the Israelites through exodus, it eventually made it's way to the holy land where it passed hands until it was taken away by the Babylonians, and eventually taken here to this museum. 
            </p>

            <p>
               Through its long history, the Ark of The Covenant has faced great decay.
               It's commandments, (and walking stick,) have long since been taken out from it. 
               Similarly, its golden detailing and ornamental seal have been taken, probably for money.
               Exactly why is anybodys guess; we don't know. The current theory by experts is that those parts where sold for money, or something.
            </p>

            <p>
               The discovery of the Ark of The Covenant despite this rough history, is remarkable.
               In 2024, it was found in an archeological site in the very center of south-east Jordan.
               At first it was suspected to be but an ordinary box, but on closer inspection from our great curators at the Museum of Cool Stuff it was found to actually be the Ark of The Covenant, to the wider academic world's suprise.

      <h2>The Holy Grail</h2>

            <p>
               The Holy Grail is derived from the Holy Chalice; the vessel that Jesus used during the Last Supper.
               There are many Holy Chalices throughout the world that claim to be that very same, such as the Nanteos Cup, the Chalice of Do√±a Urraca, or the Antioch Chalice.
            </p>

            <p>
               However, our exhibition does not claim to have the Holy Chalice! 
               Rather, we here at the Museum of Cool Stuff have the Holy Grail, which is totally different.
               The Holy Grail has a long history of its own, as a magical healing item originating from old French stories from the eleventh century. 
               These stories often centered around King Arthur of Britain, and his quests for this grail.
               This is a testament to the Holy Grail's magical nature, as these stories seemingly predicted 800 years into the future the quest King Arthur would have in the movie Monty Python And the Holy Grail,
               which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9B7fBPhWzU">free to watch officially on youtube.</a>
            </p>

            <p>
               The acquisition of the Holy Grail required a similarly remarkable quest for our curators here at the Museum of Cool Stuff.
               Despite it being the name of the movie, they never find the Holy Grail in the movie, so we did not know where to begin.
               However, searching through the many pawn shops of the United Kingdom, we found a suspiciously ornamental cup.
               Although not looking like anything from the movie, our diligent curators nonetheless identified it to be the Holy Grail.
            </p>

            <p>
               This identification was helped by it somehow actually being the Holy Grail. 
               We are not joking.
               People who drink from this become immortal.
