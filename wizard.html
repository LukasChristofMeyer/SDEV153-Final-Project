               Crystal Balls were the tools of wizards for mainly fortune-telling.
               They also were used for learning secrets of the universe, communication with demons, summoning piles of gold, creating genies, conjuration, cleaning, measuring, soccer, rugby,
                  primitive magical bowling, target practice, finding buried treasure, evaluating the shininess of mirrors through comparison, tuning compasses, communicating with the dead, pets,
                  astronomy, astrology, dragon slaying, antidisestablishmentarianism, geology, currency, turning trees into gold, trapping people within the crystal ball, polishing, pondering, and ornamental displays of wealth.
            </p>

            <p>
               The two ornamental crystal balls shown here are a unique arrangement, only seen from archeological sites by wizards of the Linear Pottery Culture of Neolithic Europe.
               It is theorized to be used for a certain type of arcane druidic magic, which deals with the infinitude of the seventh realm.
               These magics were only for the most aristocratic of wizards at the time, and not many wizards knew how to use them.
               Yet, the knowledge of such magics remained, as the crystal balls displayed in this exhibit are a later reproduction found in the archeological sites of the cultures of Anthropocene Europe.
               Now, whilst we at the Museum of Cool Stuff do not know exactly what any of the above means, we think its probably pretty cool, so we brought it into the Museum of Cool Stuff for display.

               In this display, we can see a crystal ball that is currently looking into the future, just like how wizards would use them for fortune-telling.
               Currently as you may see, it is telling the supposed future stock market price. 
            </p>

            <p>
               If you do not see anything this may be because you are not a wizard and thus cannot see the secrets of the universe.
               Sorry.
            </p>

            <p>
               The crystal ball accomplishes this future sight by turning itself from the crystal it was prior to the spell into a magical stone which wizards can observe the future through.
               This is in part why it has remained this way since 1929 when its magician sold it away, as the stone stayed the same without a wizard casting a spell to turn it back.
               It is through similar magic that we here at the Museum of Cool Stuff theorize why Jupiter looks that way.

      <h2>The Emerald Tablet</h2>

      <div class="section-division">
         <div class="text">
            <p>
               The Emerald Tablet, also known as the Smaragadine Table or Tabula Smaragdina, is attributed to being created by Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary ancient greek alchemist.
               However, this is not true. 
               Hermes Trismegistus's version was actually a incomplete translation of another Emerald Tablet from ancient China, which we have on display here.
               Its original creator made it for the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, in attempt to secure immortality.
               Unfortunately, it was only finished Qin Shi Huang drank a mercury based elixer of immortality and promptly died.
               It was then buried with him in his tomb alongside the terracotta army, until someone stole it.
            </p>

            <p>
               The Emerald Tablet is extraordinarly magical in nature.
               It only has a few Chinese characters on it, but it apparently holds infinite knowledge if we could read its true message.
               Such knowledge includes instructions to produce a Philosophers Stone, which can grant immortality and turn lead into gold.
               Also, we think the dragons on it probably do something cool. We don't know though. 
               Again, we here at the Museum of Cool Stuff cannot read Chinese.

      <h2>The Philosopher's Stone</h2>
      <div class="section-division">
         <img src="images/philosophers-stone.jpg" alt="The Philosopher's Stone: a square green crystal">

            <p>
               The Philosopher's Stone is the main subject of the Emerald Tablet, and is the pinnacle of magic alchemy.
               It can grant immortality and turn lead into gold. It also can even turn gold into lead, to then turn into gold!
               However, this requires the use of magic, which we do not know how to do.
            </p>

            <p>
               There have been many Philosopher's Stones from many different cultures of antiquity, including from ancient Greece, medieval India, medieval Europe, and the medieval Middle East.
               Not many of them have worked though.
               This is why they are called Philosopher's Stones, since many philosophers have pondered why they could not get it to actually work.
               Their writings have mysteriously been lost to history.
               One conspiracy theory suggests it is because if they could turn lead into gold, their economy would crash due to increased inflation, and so the information on how to do so got covered up.
               Another more credible theory is that they all failed, and so nobody cared enough to write it down.
            </p>
               
            <p>
               Sadly not many modern Philosopher's Stones survive, as they are very tiny, only about a tenth of an inch in diameter, and so lost easily. 
               The picture on display is actually zoomed in to an incredibly degree.
               Indeed, we are lucky to have a Philosophers Stone at all, as the one on display was only found when panning for gold at a tourist attraction.
